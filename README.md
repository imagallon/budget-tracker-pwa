# budget-tracker-pwa

## Description

This app is intended for anyone keep track of their budget. Users can enter positive income and negative expenses. One of the best features of this app is that users can use this while offline and still keep track of their expenses. This is my first time implementing a Progresive Web Application (PWA). I learned how to make a manifest and create a service worker that would handle my caching. I think PWAs are pretty cool because the can be downloaded and run like a native app.
